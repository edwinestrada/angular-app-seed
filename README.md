Angular application with batteries included :battery:. Package contents:
+ [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) as a bundler/general magic worker.
+ [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for future-proof JavaScript :fire:.
+ [Foundation for Sites](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites) for front-end :sparkles:.
+ [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for task management.
+ [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for less refreshes.

+ [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) as a test runner.
